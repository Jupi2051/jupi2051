# Hello there! Welcome to my github profile!

If you don't find much to look at right now, that's okay, and its for one of two reasons:
* It is a personal project that is currently in production and i don't want to share it
* It is a project that I worked on for a client, and I cannot really share what they paid for!
  
**(i'll add more projects to it later i promise)**
